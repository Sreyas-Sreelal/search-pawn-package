# search-pawn-package

This is a simple vscode extension which provides pawn package suggestions in your pawn.json with the help of SouthClaw' pawndex api.
This extension is still under developement and not ready to use.Also this is the first time i'm working on an extension for vscode and i'm still a rookie in typescript therefore the code won't be perefect and i really appreciate reviews or pull requests so that i can improve :).
